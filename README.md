Introduction
============

The Currencycloud API is designed for businesses that want to make
international payments. By accessing our Payment Engine via our API, you can
automate your end-to-end payment processes and rapidly deliver
tailor-made solutions for your customers.

Our API is built by developers for developers, making it straightforward
to integrate with our systems.

In order to use the API demo, you must register for an API key at
<https://developer.currencycloud.com/api-register/>.

Postman and setup
=================

Currencycloud no longer maintains a dedicated Postman file. 

Instead we rely on a OpenAPI Specification (OAS) based Swagger file definition which may be used with
Postman.
 
See the <https://github.com/CurrencyCloud/currencycloud-swagger/blob/master/POSTMAN_README.md> file for
details regarding the use of the Swagger file with Postman.
